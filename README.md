# GemChallenge API

## Introduction

The **GemChallenge API** is designed to determine energy production from various power plants. This document explains how to build and run the API.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Git repository** for the project:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/....
    ```

2. **Restore the NuGet packages**:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

4. **Run the application** (click the green "Run" button if you are using Visual Studio :p):
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

5. **Access Swagger** at `https://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html` to interact with the API.

6. **Note**: The API is not yet secured due to time constraints. However, you can click "Try it" or provide the input you wish to test and execute the requests.
